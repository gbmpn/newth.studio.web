# bw-router

[![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

`bw-router` will allow you to create routes and associate them with a value/object. These values are called
sections as this router was originally designed for bigwheel.

If the this module is running in the browser it will use `window.location.hash` to evaluate routes. If it's not
running in an environment where `window.location` exists then it will be ignored.


## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bw-router.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bw-router)

### Example

```javascript
var bwRouter = require( 'bw-router' );

var router = bwRouter( {
  
  '/': { name: 'landing section' }, // this is the root route and will be opened right away after init
  '/about': { section: { name: 'about section' }, useURL: false }, // a settings object can be passed
                                                                   // instead of a section object.
                                                                   // `useURL` ensures that this route
                                                                   // cannot be entered via hash changes
  '/gallery/:image': { name: 'gallery' }, // routes can be defined with parameters for more info visit: 
                                          // https://www.npmjs.com/package/routes
  '/someRedirect': '/about', // redirects can be created
  '404': { name: '404' } // 404 can be defined which will always evaluate if the route is not matched,
  postHash: '!' // Defines what prefixes the routes
  pushState: true, // Whether to use the history api or not
});

router.init(); // calling init will start resolving routes

router.go( '/gallery/10' ); // calling go will cause the router to evaluate 

router.go( '/gallery/10', {silent: true} ); // will not trigger a section change, useful for scrolling sites

router.destroy(); // will destroy the router
```
